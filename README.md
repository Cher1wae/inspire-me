🧠 Overview

Inspire Me is a lightweight quote generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is simple — to inspire users instantly with uplifting quotes whenever they visit or click the button.

Users can:

View a random motivational quote each time they click the “Inspire Me” button.

Refresh for new inspiration anytime.

Enjoy a clean, responsive, and minimalist design that works on any device.

✨ Features

✅ Random motivational quotes displayed on button click
✅ Clean and responsive interface
✅ Simple JavaScript logic — no frameworks needed
✅ Fast load time, no external dependencies
✅ Easy to extend with your own quotes or API

🧩 How It Works

The app stores an array of motivational quotes in script.js.

When you click the Inspire Me button, JavaScript randomly selects one quote.

The quote is displayed dynamically in the app’s main section.

You can click repeatedly for a fresh dose of inspiration each time.
